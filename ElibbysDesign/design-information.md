## Design Information


1. This requirement is realized within my design. The Remainders class consists all editting features that allows users the ability to manipulate the app to their benefit.

2. The class diagram contains several classes with their attributes and operations, as well as utility classes, and directional relationships.

3. I did not consider this requirement within the class diagram.

4. This requirement was not considered because it doesn't affect the design.

5. This function is shown within the Reminder Database class which contains the operation "saveReminder(): void"

6. The requirement is realized within the Reminder Database class which contains the operation "keepTaskIfFinished(Reminder task): void"

7. The requirement is realized within the Reminder Database class which contains the operation "clearCheckedTasks(): void" 

8. This design was implemented into the model through the "saveFinishedTask(): void" operation within the Remainder Database superclass

9. This requirement is implemented within design through the classes Organizational Lists and Time- Sensitive Schedules which then have subclasses To-do Lists and Shopping Lists and Appointments, respectively.

10. I did not consider this aspect within my design model.

11. This function was realized through several parts of my class diagram including the Remainder Database class which has "sendNotification(): void" operation, and the "repeatReminder(): return date" operation within the Reminder class

12. The utility class "Location" provides a supporting role to requirement 11.

13. This is not considered within my design.
