1. As a user of the system, I want a list of reminders that I should be aware of and the ability to add, delete, or edit reminders in the list.
   - To realize this requirement, I created the `ReminderList` class, allowing users to add, delete, and edit reminders.

2. The application must have a database (DB) of reminders and related data.
   - This requirement is fulfilled by the `ReminderDB` class which handles the storage and management of reminders.

3. Users should be able to add reminders by selecting from a hierarchical list, the first level being reminder type and the second being the actual reminder name.
   - This is realized through the relationships between `ReminderList`, `Reminder`, and `ReminderType` classes.

4. Users should also be able to specify a reminder by typing its name, prompting the application to search its DB for similar names. If a close match isn't found, it should prompt the user to select or add a reminder type before saving in the DB.
   - This functionality is housed in the `ReminderDB` class, which manages reminder searches and user interactions in case of mismatches.

5. Changes to reminders, once made, should be saved immediately.
   - The `ReminderDB` class addresses this requirement by saving reminders as soon as they're modified.

6. Users need the capability to mark reminders as completed without deleting them and to clear all these marks at once.
   - This is implemented in the `ReminderList` and `Reminder` classes, enabling users to toggle reminders as completed and to clear all such marks simultaneously.

7. Check-off marks should be persistent and saved immediately.
   - The `Reminder` class tracks these check-off statuses and the `ReminderDB` ensures they are saved instantly.

8. Reminders in the application should be grouped by type.
   - This grouping is facilitated by the interplay between `ReminderList`, `Reminder`, and `ReminderType` classes.

9. The application should support multiple reminder lists concurrently (e.g., "Weekly," "Monthly," "Kid's Reminders") and allow users to create, rename, select, or delete these lists.
   - The `ReminderListsManager` class addresses this requirement, providing users with comprehensive management options for reminder lists.

10. The User Interface (UI) should be user-friendly and responsive.
   - This requirement isn't directly addressed in the UML design since it concerns the system's architecture and not the user interface.
